    <h1>My favorite pet</h1>
    <p>My favorite pet, <em>pinky</em> keeps me company during my good and bad times.</p>
    <p>I can write a book about the cat but here are the most outstanding:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It loves being pampered</li>
        <li>It doesn't eat fish; pukes at the site of it</li>
    
    </ul>
    <p>Pinky is also notorius for the following reasons:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>It eats every 3 to 4 hours</li> 
        <li>Whenever am in the house, it would follow my everywhere</li>
        <li>pinky loves playing around with its toys whenever its full.</li>
    </ol>
